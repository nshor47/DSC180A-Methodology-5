**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic I think we've covered so far this quarter is the Generative AI life cycle which Dr. Arsanjani has provided us plenty of information on. It is really interesting to see how it is different from the Predictive AI cycle and it is cool to learn about something so up-to-date in the world.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I would like to take a deeper look into creating a Generative AI model that is able to ingest some news article, the author, the date, and some other meta data and then provide back an overview of how the news article may or may not classify as mis/disinformation. This would also entail using predictive AI models and training the Generative AI model to complete this specific task.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would have taken more time to focus on collecting useful data by scraping the web because the models I have created are decent, but they don't have ideal datasets to get trained and tested on making their performance lackluster. Creating the right datasets and features will help solve this problem.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I want to try to implement data distillations into my data collection so that I can provide more context for my Generative AI and Predictive AI models. This entails trying to do sentiment analysis on my data, topic modeling, event time lining, entity resolution/extraction etc. These will all take some data I currently have and enrich it so that it is more useful for my models, which in turn will let them create better predictions.
